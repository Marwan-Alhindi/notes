What I'm currently thinking of is that I want to build something that mix these three components:

1- Fun, and something triggers the always checking the app like social media (Addictive)
2- Something social (Connection)
3- Something with AI Agents (The thrill of uncertainty of AI Agents making unexpected results)
4- Something that always grows and make us feels achievements and growing (like ranking systems in games) (Grows)

So currently, I believe the four keywords for a successfull fun idea of a startup is:
Addictive + Connection + Uncertain + Grows

## Things I might consider for the game/app!
- What if the reward is to buy AI Agents to join your village!
  - Now I have to think about the challenges that make reward so you can buy agents
-
