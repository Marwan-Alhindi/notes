- How can you find the min, max of a function on a specific domain?




- is the domain a specific value or a function?
  - if the domain is a specific value
    - 1. subsitute the value into the function
    - 2. find the derivative of the new function dg/dy or dg/dx
    - 3. from the first derivative you can find the other variable (say in step 2, you found x, in step 3 you find y)
    - 4. Compute the second derivative and check for max,min and saddle
    - 5. subsitute x and y to find z
    - 6. subsitute both specific domains x, y in function and find z for each combination of x,y
  - if the domain is a function
