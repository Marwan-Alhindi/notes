# Inverses
- How can you undo a transformation of a matrix?
- Whats the inverse of a 2D or 3D matrices? How can you find them?
- How can you find the identity matrix using 3D? Using the second law approach?
- What does Ax = b means if x is the dimensions and A is a transformation and b are constants?
- What does x = A^-1 b means when x is the dimensions and A is the transformation and b is the output vector?
- Say you have matrix A and you applied transformatuon B which created C = BA, and then you found the determinent of matrix C which turns out to be 0, what does this mean? What if its not 0? When can you recover A from the matrix C?
