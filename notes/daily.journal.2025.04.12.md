# What's on your mind? Organise your thoughts!
I recently shifted my second brain system to dendron + todoist. There are two reasons for this. One is that I realized I dont have a sufficient task-todo management system. I need something that is very quickly at assigning tasks and I can structure my life as a tree on the main things that I realized it effects my life. The second reason is that I need a note taking system that helps me write more code and less notes. Dendron with the ability to be in VS code, allows this. The other cool thing about dendron is how fast its to create notes! This is the first day of my dendron + todoist system and I feel already way more productive.

Another thing that's been bothering me lately is that I been focusing on mainly my project and learning sections while ignoring my work section. I **need to priortize work section more currently!**

I also need to buy clothes asap and my need to put more efforts into my **hygiene** so both **Health: Body input** & also **Enviorment: Clothes and items**
