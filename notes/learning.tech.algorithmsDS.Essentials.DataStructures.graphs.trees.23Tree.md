# ✅ 2-3 Tree

## Structure:
Each node can have 1 or 2 keys and up to 3 children; always balanced.

## Use when:
You want a balanced tree without rotations like AVL.

## Example:
Used in file systems, database indexing, and as a base for B-trees.

## Time Complexity:
- Search/Insert/Delete: O(log n) → Tree remains balanced with multi-key nodes.

## Code:
```python
# 2-3 trees are typically used in system-level software (e.g., DBMS).
# Not natively implemented in Python standard libraries.
