- How can you find a unit vector in the direction of a vector? What does this means really?
  - How can you find the unit vector of a general vector using cos of angels?
- Why do we use dot product? Whats the resulting scaler means? Can u give an example of this using LLMs architecture?
- How can you find the minimum seperation between two lines? Solve the following example: ![alt text](image-8.png)
