# The things that make an app cool
1- Fun, and something triggers the always checking the app like social media (Addictive)
2- Something social (Connection)
3- The thrill of uncertainty of unexpected results (Uncertanity)
4- Something that always grows and make us feels achievements and growing (like ranking systems in games) (Grows)

So currently, I believe the four keywords for a successfull fun idea of a startup is:
Addictive + Connection + Uncertain + Grows

# Feature 1: AI RAG System (Grows + Addictive)
- AI can be used to generate notes
- AI can be used to retreieve notes. Each library can have a specific AI for it.
  - or the database should reflect the libraries and there will be one single LLM that rertrieve only from one library after figuring out that the prompt of the user is related to only that library

# Feature 2: Like + comments on other people villages (Connection + Uncertain + Addictive)
- Users can join other people villages and react + comment on their daily habits/streaks and their notes.

# Feature 3: Public Villages (Connection + Uncertain + Grows)
- Users can join each other worlds.

# Feature 4: Daily streaks (Addiction + Grows)
- As long as the user log in and do a habit or write any note, then the streak is achieved.


# Feature 5: XP/Currency & Leveling System (Addiction + Grows)

## How does the user gain XP?
- Feature 6: Habit Tracking 

## What will the user use the XP/Currency for?
- Feature 6: Cosmotic and decoration 
- Feature 7: Leaderboard

# Feature 6: Habit Tracking Building (Addictive + Grows)

# Feature 7: Cosmotic and decoration (Addictive + Grows)

# Feature 8: Leaderboard (Addictive + Connection + Grows + Uncertain)

# Feature 9: In-App Chat (Connection)

# Feature 10: Writing Notes (Grows)

# Feature 11: Building The Village (Addictive + Grows) -- (THIS FEATURE IS NOT MVP)
- For an MVP, the user will have access to a prebuilt libraries in the world and he can add the notes inside them.

# Feature 12: Moving Character in 3D Village

# Feature 13: Camera Control while moving character

# Feature 14: Easy accessibility of notes
- I dont need to go to the village to access the notes. There should be easy to access UI everywhere in the village.

# Feature 15: Easy accessibility of writing notes
- I dont need to go to the village to write the notes. There should be easy to access UI everywhere in the village.

# Feature 16: Hireachy of notes
- The user have a screen in each library that shows the hireachy of the current node and then when the user click on a sub note
[Checkout the diagram of notes hirachy](./minota.excalidraw)

# Feature 17: Private/Public Note Choice

# Feature 18: TODO List building

# Feature 19: You can restructure the notes hireachy
- Math -> Calculus -> Integration. The user will be able to change it to Math -> Meow -> Integration. And then Integration hireachy should be reflected as math.meow.integration or something like this
