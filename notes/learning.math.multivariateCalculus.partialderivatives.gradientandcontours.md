## Gradient and countours
- On a given, contour does the function change?
  - if the function doesnt change, then the directional derivative is? At any given value x,y,z that result in a value in the contour, whats the directional derivative equal to for any vectors on the contour?
- Can u explain unit vector and gradient vector on contours?
  - What does it mean u hat to be tangent to the contours, what does it mean when its not? What does that means to the gradient vector? 
  - How will the gradient vector point to the steepest slope when the unit vector is tangent to the line?
  - What about if the unit vector is pointing inside the contours, whats the angle between the gradient vector and the unit vector? is it 90, 0 or between?
