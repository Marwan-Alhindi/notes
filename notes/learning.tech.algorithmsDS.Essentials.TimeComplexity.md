- Whats space time trade offs?
- Whats limits got to do with calculating time complexity?
- What are the steps to calculate time complexity of a code?
- What are the worst, best and average cases when designing or looking into an algorithm?
- Can u mention the order of growth rates? n, loglogn, nlogn, n2, n3 and 2n? which one is the highest?
- What does logarithms got to do with algorithms and calculating the time complexity of an algorithm?
