- Whats ratio test and why do we need it?
- How can you use the ratio test to know that a series converges, diverges or the ratio test isnt sufficient?
- is ratio test only used on series or sequence as well?
- Why when we apply the approach of a_n+1 / a_n and then we subsitute and then we apply limit on it: if we get 1 = 1 then the test is inclusive, 1< then the series converges and >1, the series diverges!? Why is this?
- How does this equal to half? ![alt text](image-28.png)



# !!!misconception!!!
- do you subsitute the lower value of the sum or the upper when evalating the ratio test?
