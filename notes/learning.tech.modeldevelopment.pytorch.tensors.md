- How to create a tensor from a list of lists and from a numpy array?
- how to define the data type of tensors?
- how to do ones like tensor?
- how to do random like tensor?
- how to do random, ones and zeros with a specific shape?
- How can you change a tensor to python array?
- how can u check the shape, type and **device?**
- What are accelerators? How can you change them in bolab?
- Whats the default accelerator for tensors? How do you move them to another accelerator? Is it expensive to move tensors from devices/accelerators?
- how to concatenate tensors? how to specify dimensionallty?
- how to perform matrix multiplication using matmul and @?
- how to perform dot product using mul and other?
- how to perform operations on the array itself? (in place operations)
- if you changed a tensor to a numpy, and then changed the numpy array, does the tensor also changes? and vice versa?
