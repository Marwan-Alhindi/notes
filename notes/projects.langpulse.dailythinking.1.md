# What does the solution of having LLMs to have a tree structure like and referencign to a parent LLM solve? How does LLM focus on a specific person solve?

so i been having this idea of having like a tree like LLMs where in my langpulse app, an LLM can have a parent LLM and a parent member. 

The idea is that the user can choose the percentage of how much the LLM should focus on for each LLM and each member.

Since my app will have multiple people and multiple LLMs, its impossible that the LLM remembers and interact with everything, right?
