# Parent node and human: the user can set the percentage of focus and memory of an LLM

What does this solution solve? 

## 1. Context Overload Problem

The problem:
In systems with many users and LLMs, storing and injecting everything into each LLM‚Äôs context is infeasible and expensive.

Your solution:
By assigning focus percentages, you selectively narrow down what an LLM pays attention to ‚Äî making the interaction efficient, scalable, and relevant.


## 2. Memory Management in Multi-user Settings
