- Whats dijksta algorithm and whats the purpose of it?
- How does it work?
- Whats the data structure used to represent the graph?
- Whats the data structure used to get to the next closest node?
- whats the data structure used to store and update the shortest distances?
- Whats the data structure used to store visited nodes?
- Whats the time complexity for dihjkstra?

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)

    while pq:
        curr_dist, node = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if curr_dist > distances[node]:
            continue  # Skip if already visited with a shorter path

        for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
            dist = curr_dist + weight
            if dist < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = dist
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist, neighbor))

    return distances

graph = {
    'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],
    'B': [('C', 2), ('D', 5)],
    'C': [('D', 1)],
    'D': []
}

print(dijkstra(graph, 'A'))

## ðŸ•’ Time Complexity of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

### ðŸ§  What is Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm?
- Finds the **shortest path** from a source node to all other nodes in a **graph with non-negative edge weights**.

---

### âœ… Time Complexity Based on Implementation

| Graph Representation        | Priority Queue     | Time Complexity      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Adjacency Matrix            | No heap (array)    | O(VÂ²)                |
| Adjacency List              | Binary Heap        | O((V + E) log V)     |
| Adjacency List              | Fibonacci Heap     | O(E + V log V)       |

---

### ðŸ“Œ Parameters:
- `V` = number of vertices
- `E` = number of edges
- **Binary Heap** (e.g., using `heapq` in Python) is most commonly used in practice.

---

### ðŸš« Limitations:
- Does **not** work with **negative edge weights**.
- For graphs with negative weights, use **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** instead.
