# Directional Derivatives
- Whats directional derivative? What does it tells us?
- Whats the law to calculate it?
- What does the result actually tells you?


## Quick note:
What is the rate of change of f(x, y) in the direction where x increases by 1 unit, and y increases by 2 units â€” scaled to unit length?
