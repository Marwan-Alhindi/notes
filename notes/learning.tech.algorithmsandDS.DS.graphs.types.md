ðŸ”¹ 1. Directed Graph (Digraph)
	â€¢	Edges have a direction (from one vertex to another)
	â€¢	Example: Twitter (A follows B â‰  B follows A)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Undirected Graph
	â€¢	Edges do not have direction (mutual connection)
	â€¢	Example: Facebook friends

ðŸ”¹ 3. Weighted Graph
	â€¢	Each edge has a numeric weight (e.g., distance, cost)
	â€¢	Used in Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, road networks

ðŸ”¹ 4. Unweighted Graph
	â€¢	All edges are treated equally (no weights)
	â€¢	Used in BFS for shortest path

ðŸ”¹ 5. Cyclic Graph
	â€¢	Contains at least one cycle
	â€¢	Example: Graph with A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ A

ðŸ”¹ 6. Acyclic Graph
	â€¢	No cycles
	â€¢	If directed: called a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
	â€¢	Used in scheduling tasks, topological sorting

ðŸ”¹ 7. Connected Graph
	â€¢	Undirected: There is a path between any two vertices

ðŸ”¹ 8. Disconnected Graph
	â€¢	Some nodes are not reachable from others
