# ✅ AVL Tree

## Structure:
A binary search tree where the balance factor of each node is maintained (between -1 and 1).

## Use when:
You need ordered data with guaranteed fast search, insert, and delete times.

## Example:
Databases, memory managers, or real-time systems.

## Time Complexity:
- Insert/Delete/Search: O(log n) → Tree height is always balanced, so operations depend on depth (logarithmic).

## Code (Conceptual):
```python
# Use library like `avl` or custom implementation.
# Insertions may cause rotations to maintain balance.
